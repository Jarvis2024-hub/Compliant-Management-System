# ResolvePro – System Requirements

This document outlines all the software and dependencies needed to run the ResolvePro Complaint Management System.

---

## Backend Requirements

### Core Software

**PHP 8.x or higher**
- Required for running the backend API
- Must have CLI access (command-line interface)
- XAMPP's PHP installation works fine: `C:\xampp\php\php.exe`
- Verify installation: `php --version`

**MySQL 8.x or higher**
- Database management system
- Can be installed via XAMPP, WAMP, or standalone
- XAMPP is recommended for ease of use

**XAMPP (Recommended)**
- Provides both PHP and MySQL
- Includes phpMyAdmin for database management
- Download: https://www.apachefriends.org/
- Note: We only use XAMPP for MySQL and PHP, not Apache

### System Requirements

**Port Availability**
- Port 8000 must be available for the PHP built-in server
- Port 3306 for MySQL (default)
- Check if port is in use: `netstat -ano | findstr :8000`

**Operating System**
- Windows 10/11 (current setup)
- Linux and macOS also supported with minor path adjustments

### PHP Extensions (Usually included with XAMPP)

The following PHP extensions must be enabled:
- `pdo_mysql` - Database connectivity
- `openssl` - For JWT and encryption
- `json` - JSON encoding/decoding
- `mbstring` - String handling

You can verify extensions in `php.ini` or by running: `php -m`

## Frontend Requirements

### Core Software

**Flutter SDK 3.x or higher**
- Cross-platform mobile development framework
- Download: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
- Verify installation: `flutter --version`

**Dart SDK 3.x or higher**
- Comes bundled with Flutter
- No separate installation needed

**Android Studio or VS Code**
- IDE for development
- Android Studio recommended for Android emulator
- VS Code is lighter weight alternative

**Android SDK (for Android development)**
- Comes with Android Studio
- Required for building and running Android apps
- Minimum SDK version: 21 (Android 5.0)

### Flutter Packages

The following packages are used in this project (from `pubspec.yaml`):

**HTTP Communication**
- `http: ^1.1.0` - Making API requests to backend

**Authentication**
- `google_sign_in: ^7.2.0` - Google OAuth integration

**Local Storage**
- `shared_preferences: ^2.2.2` - Storing user session data locally

**State Management**
- `provider: ^6.1.1` - Managing app state across screens

**UI Components**
- `cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2` - iOS-style icons
- `flutter_spinkit: ^5.2.0` - Loading animations

**Development Tools**
- `flutter_test` - Testing framework (SDK)
- `flutter_launcher_icons: ^0.14.4` - App icon generation

To install all Flutter dependencies, run:
```bash
cd D:\visanka\complaint_mgmt_App
flutter pub get
```

## Development Environment Setup

### For Backend Development

1. Install XAMPP
2. Ensure PHP CLI is accessible from command line
3. Start MySQL service
4. Import database schema via phpMyAdmin

### For Flutter Development

1. Install Flutter SDK
2. Add Flutter to system PATH
3. Run `flutter doctor` to verify setup
4. Install Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter extension
5. Set up Android emulator or connect physical device

---

## Network Requirements

**For Android Emulator Testing**
- Use `http://10.0.2.2:8000` as API base URL
- This is the emulator's alias for host machine's localhost

**For Physical Device Testing**
- Backend server must use `0.0.0.0:8000` (not `localhost:8000`)
- Find your computer's local IP: `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Linux/Mac)
- Use `http://192.168.x.x:8000` as API base URL in Flutter app
- Ensure device and computer are on the same network

**Firewall Considerations**
- If testing on physical device, Windows Firewall may block port 8000
- Add exception for PHP or temporarily disable firewall for testing

---

## Optional Tools

**Git**
- Version control system
- Download: https://git-scm.com/
- Used for tracking changes and collaboration

**Postman or Thunder Client**
- API testing tools
- Useful for testing backend endpoints independently
- Not required but helpful for debugging

**MySQL Workbench**
- Alternative to phpMyAdmin
- More advanced database management features
- Download: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

---

## Minimum Hardware Recommendations

**For Development Machine**
- CPU: Dual-core processor (Quad-core recommended)
- RAM: 8GB minimum (16GB recommended for running emulator)
- Storage: 10GB free space (Flutter SDK and Android SDK are large)
- Internet: Required for initial setup and package downloads

**For Android Emulator**
- Requires hardware virtualization (Intel VT-x or AMD-V)
- Enable in BIOS if not already enabled
- Check in Task Manager > Performance > CPU > Virtualization

## Verification Checklist

Before running the project, verify:

- [ ] PHP 8.x installed and accessible via command line
- [ ] MySQL running (check XAMPP Control Panel)
- [ ] Flutter SDK installed (`flutter doctor` shows no critical errors)
- [ ] Database `complaint_management` created and schema imported
- [ ] Port 8000 is available
- [ ] Android emulator or physical device ready
- [ ] All Flutter packages installed (`flutter pub get` completed)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**"PHP is not recognized as an internal or external command"**
- Add PHP to system PATH: `C:\xampp\php`
- Restart command prompt after adding to PATH

**"Port 8000 is already in use"**
- Find process using port: `netstat -ano | findstr :8000`
- Kill process or use different port

**"Flutter doctor shows errors"**
- Run `flutter doctor -v` for detailed information
- Most common: Android licenses not accepted
- Fix: `flutter doctor --android-licenses`

**"Cannot connect to backend from Flutter app"**
- Verify backend is running: open `http://localhost:8000` in browser
- Check API base URL in `lib/config/api_config.dart`
- For emulator, must use `10.0.2.2` not `localhost`
